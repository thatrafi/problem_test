Expected time for this test: 60 minutes.

Instructions:
- Database is resetted on each startup for testing purposes.
- Install composer dependencies.
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your local mysql server credentials.
- To startup a server locally, run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t src/` from project rootdir.
- For a simple check, run `php src/index.php` from project rootdir.
- To check phpunit test case state, run `vendor/bin/phpunit` from project rootdir.

Requirements:
1. Make neccesary adjustments so that phpunit test cases pass.
2. Do any code changes that you think:
    - Are not up to latest standards,
    - Have underlying vulnerbilities,
    - Or there's a better way of doing it
3. (optional) Improve performance of current database schema in database.sql.
